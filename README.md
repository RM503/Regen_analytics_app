# Regen Organics app
## What is this app for?
This is an analytics app designed by DataKind for Regen Organics, serving two primary purposes:

* Generate key statistics related to planting cycles and crop growth using vegetation indices (NDVI and NDMI) with the help of Google Earth Engine (GEE) backend
* Serve as an analytics dashboard containing data and visualizations from pre-existing analyses and trained models which can be further supplement by queries from the end-user(s)

The design and functionality of this app relies heavily on the workflow carried out during the research phases of the project - which includes data generation, visualization, ETL and ML model training. The codebase can be accessed through the following link
